        <h1>Be your own doctor...</h1>
        <p>
            It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctor’s help
            immediately, but they are not available due to some reasons. The Disease Prediction system
            is an end user support and online consultation project. Here, we propose a web application
            that allows users to get instant guidance on their disease through an intelligent system.
            The application is fed with various details and the disease associated with those details.
            The application allows users to share their disease-related issues. It then processes user-specific
            details to check for various illnesses that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent
            data mining techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s
            details. Based on result, patient can contact doctor accordingly for further treatment.
